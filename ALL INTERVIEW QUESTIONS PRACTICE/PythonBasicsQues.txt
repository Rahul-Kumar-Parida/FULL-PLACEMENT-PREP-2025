1)  What are the key features of  python?
#.......Sir, Python is a simple and easy-to-read programming language. It is an interpreted language, so it runs code line by line. Python is dynamically typed, which means we don’t need to define variable types. It supports object-oriented programming, functional programming, and procedural programming. Python has automatic memory management, so we don’t need to handle memory manually. It works on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Python also has many built-in libraries that help in data science, web development, and automation.

2)  What are keywords in python?
#........Sir, keywords in Python are special reserved words that have a fixed meaning and cannot be used as variable names or function names. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python. Examples of keywords are if, else, while, for, def, class, try, except, return, True, False. Python has a total of 33 keywords in Python 3. They help in writing control flow, loops, functions, and exception handling.

3) What are the literals in Python?
#........Sir, literals in Python are fixed values assigned to variables. They represent constant data. There are different types of literals:
String Literals – Text inside quotes, like "Hello" or 'Python'.
Numeric Literals – Numbers like 10, 3.14, or 5+3j (integer, float, complex).
Boolean Literals – True and False, used for logical operations.
None Literal – None, which represents no value or an empty variable.(special Literal)
Literals are used to store data directly in variables.

    return "Hello, " + name  
print(greet("John"))  # Output: Hello, John

There are two types of functions:
Built-in functions – Like print(), len(), sum().
User-defined functions – Functions created by the programmer.
Functions increase code reusability and readability.

map(function, iterable)
function → A function to apply to each element.
iterable → The sequence (list, tuple, etc.) to process.

num=[1,2,3,4]
lst=list(map(lambda x:x**2, num))
print(lst)

35)What is __init__ in python?
The __init__ method in Python is a special method (constructor) that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize object attributes.
class example:

PyLint – Checks Python code for errors, coding standards, and style violations.


37)What is the difference between a tuple and a dictionary.
Sir, a tuple and a dictionary are both data structures in Python, but they have key differences:

Definition:
A tuple is an ordered collection of elements.
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Mutability:
Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
Dictionaries are mutable, so we can add, remove, or modify elements.
Accessing Elements:
In a tuple, we access elements using an index (tup[0]).
In a dictionary, we access values using keys (dict["name"]).
Duplicates:
Tuples allow duplicate values.
Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys, but values can be repeated.

38)what is pass in python?
In Python, pass is a placeholder statement that does nothing when executed. It is used in situations where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed at that moment.
def future_function():
    pass  # Placeholder for future code

39)How can an object copied in python?
In Python, objects can be copied using the copy module. There are two types of copies:

1. Shallow Copy (copy.copy())
Creates a new object but does not copy nested objects; they are referenced.
Changes in nested objects affect both original and copied objects.

import copy
original_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]
shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)
shallow_copy[1][0] = 99  # Modifying nested list
print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [99, 3], 4] (Nested list affected)

2. Deep Copy (copy.deepcopy())
Recursively copies all objects, including nested ones.
Changes in nested objects do not affect the original.

deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
deep_copy[1][0] = 100  # Modifying nested list
print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [99, 3], 4] (Original remains unchanged)

40) How can a number converted to a string?
We can convert a number to a string in Python using the str() function
num = 123
str_num = str(num)
print(str_num)  # Output: '123'
print(type(str_num))  # Output: <class 'str'>


41)What are modules and package in python?

Module:
A module is a single Python file (.py) that contains functions, classes, or variables.
It helps organize code and promotes reusability.
You can import a module using import module_name.

Example:
# mymodule.py
def greet():
    return "Hello, World!"
# main.py
import mymodule
print(mymodule.greet())  # Output: Hello, World!
Package:
A package is a collection of multiple modules stored in a directory.
It contains an __init__.py file (optional in Python 3+) to mark it as a package.
You can import modules from a package using from package_name import module_name.

Example:
mypackage/
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
├── module2.py

# module1.py
def say_hello():
    return "Hello from Module 1!"

# main.py
from mypackage import module1
print(module1.say_hello())  # Output: Hello from Module 1!

42)What is the difference between numpy and scipy.
Sir, NumPy is mainly used for working with arrays and basic mathematical operations, while SciPy is built on top of NumPy and provides advanced scientific and engineering functions.

NumPy is good for creating and handling arrays, doing matrix operations, and performing basic math. SciPy, on the other hand, is used for more complex tasks like optimization, signal processing, and integration.

For example, in NumPy, I can create an array and do matrix multiplication, but if I need to find the determinant of a matrix, I would use SciPy.

43)What does the len() function do?
Sir, the len() function in Python is used to find the number of elements in a sequence like a list, string, tuple, or dictionary.

44)Define encapsulation in Python
Sir, encapsulation in Python is a concept of hiding data and restricting direct access to it. It is done using private and protected variables in a class.

45)What is the use of type() function in python?
Sir, the type() function in Python is used to check the data type of a variable or object.
x = 10
print(type(x)) 

46)What is the split() function used in python?
Sir, the split() function in Python is used to break a string into a list of words based on a specified separator.
text="Rahul Kumar Parida"
words=text.split()
print(words)

47)What is docstring in python?
Sir, a docstring in Python is a multi-line string used to document a function, class, or module. It helps explain what the code does.
def add(a,b):
    """This is sum"""
    return a+b
print(add.__doc__)

48)What is the use of lambda function in python.
Sir, a lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. It is used when we need a short function for a short period.
add = lambda a, b: a + b  
print(add(3, 5)) 

49)how do you find the factorial of a number using recursion.
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:  # Base case
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive call

print(factorial(5))

50)can you denote the working of the bool function with example.
Yes, sir. The bool() function in Python is used to convert a value into a Boolean (True or False).
So, bool() helps in checking whether a value exists or not.
Working of bool() Function:
Returns False for empty values (0, None, '', [], {}, set(), False).
Returns True for non-empty values (1, "hello", [1,2,3], {5}, True).
